# Zero Division Handling in JavaScript Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: incorrect handling of zero values in division operations.

The `bug.js` file contains a function `myFunction` that attempts to divide two numbers.  However, it incorrectly handles cases where either `a` or `b` is zero, potentially leading to errors.

The `bugSolution.js` file shows the corrected version, including comprehensive error handling.

## Running the Code

You can run both files using a JavaScript interpreter (like Node.js) or within a web browser's developer console.
